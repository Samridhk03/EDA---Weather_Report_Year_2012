Analyzing weather dataset using Numpy & Pandas

**Problem Statement**

We'll be working with a csv file that contains weather data for each hour in 2012. There are many interesting connections between everyday life and the weather that we will explore with the help of this dataset. Apply all the numpy and pandas skills learned so far to analyze the data.

**Questions** - There are 5 questions regarding the data, which are given below.

1. How did the temperature vary amongst the months during the year?

2. Find the variation in mean visibility, aggregated by days of the week?

3. What was the average Wind speed amongst the Months?

4. what was the observations of Dew and Humidity amongst the months?

5. What was the overall weather during the year?

**About the Dataset- Snapshot of the Dataset:**

**Features:** Name Description Date/Time Date & Time for each hour in the year 2012. Temp(C) Exact temperature at a given time. Dew Point Temp(C) Dew Point Temp at a given time. It is the temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated with water vapor. Rel Hum (%) Relative Humidity at a given time. Wind Spd (km/h) Wind Speed in km/h at a given time. Visibility (km) Visibility in km at a given time. Stn Press (kPa) Station Pressure observed at that time. Weather Weather at a given time.
